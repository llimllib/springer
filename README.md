# A testing Spring83 server

Implementing some of [this very draft spec](https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83-spec/blob/main/draft-20220616.md)

# To test

## run the server

If you have [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) installed, run `modd`. Alternatively, `go run server/main.go`

## run the client

On first run, the client will generate a keypair for you according to the spring83 spec, and store it in `~/.config/spring83/key.pub` and `~/.config/spring83/key.priv`.

This key has to meet a certain specification, so it may take some time to generate on the first run.

`echo "testing" | go run client/main.go`

## view the content

go to http://localhost:8000 while the server is running
